# Titanic Survival Prediction - Kaggle

This project applies logistic regression to predict survival outcomes of Titanic passengers based on features like age, gender, class, and fare.

## What I Did:
- Explored and cleaned the data (handled missing values, feature encoding)
- Built a logistic regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluated with 82% validation accuracy
- Submitted predictions to Kaggle and analyzed the score

## Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset:
